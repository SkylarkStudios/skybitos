# skybitos
The planned successor of the Sky8 os (aka SkyHigh OS) made with pygame to run pygame applications.
Use this code however you want to make your own OS simulators. I dont care.
Also run the os by going into os/main.py
And make sure you have pygame installed. Fore more info go to https://www.pygame.org
